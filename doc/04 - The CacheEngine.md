Using cache with the CacheEngine
================================

The Image-Charts tool is very cool but it's not always free. If you make too many requests
to the Image-Charts servers, you will need to pay. To resolve that problem, you can cache your charts.
Fortunately, the LegGCharts provides a useful CacheEngine to do that for you.

## Create the CacheEngine instance

The cache engine will require two directories to store the cache :

- the public one, accessible from users, to store charts images ;
- the internal one, inaccessible from users, to store metadata about charts ;

You can also provide an asset prefix that will be used to generate charts URL.
By default, the internal directory is directly in the library directory.

For instance:

```php
// Here we specify only the public cache directory
$cacheEngine = new CacheEngine('public/charts');

// Here we specify the public cache and the asset prefix
$cacheEngine = new CacheEngine('web/bundles/gcharts', 'bundles/gcharts/');

// Here we specify the public cache, the asset prefix and the internal cache
$cacheEngine = new CacheEngine('web/bundles/gcharts', 'bundles/gcharts/', 'app/cache/charts');
```

## Usage

The usage is very simple:

```php
$cacheEngine = new CacheEngine('web/gcharts', 'gcharts/');

echo '<img src="'. $cacheEngine->build($chart) .'" />';
```

What's happened here ?

- The cache engine is created with `web/bundles/gcharts` as public directory
- `CacheEngine::build(ChartInterface $chart, $keepTime = 3600)` is called :
	- if the chart already exists in the cache (and is fresher than $keepTime), this version is returned ;
	- if not, the Image-Charts servers are requested, and the result is stored in cache ;
- We no have a local URL, pointing to your assets directory (for instance, something like `gcharts/55852c88e2.png`)

## CacheEngine

The CacheEngine has five main methods :

- `put(ChartInterface $chart, $keepTime)` request the chart from Image-Charts servers even if it's in cache and store it ;
- `build(ChartInterface $chart, $keepTime)` call `put` if the chart is not in the cache and return a local URL for the chart
- `has(ChartInterface $chart)` check if the cache contains the chart
- `clear(ChartInterface $chart)` clear the cache for a given chart
- `clearAll()` clear the cache for all charts
